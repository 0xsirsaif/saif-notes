Computer System: A Programmers's Prespective.
==============================================

Preface
********
* a builder’s perspective, describing how to implement the hardware or the systems software, including the operating system, compiler, and network interface.
* a programmer’s perspective, describing how application programmers can use their knowledge of a system to write better programs.
* Arithmetic overflow is a common source of programming errors and security vulnerabilities, yet few other books cover the properties of computer arithmetic from a programmer’s perspective.
* [in the machine-level representation of programs] One certain benefit is that you will develop a thorough and concrete understanding of pointers.
* To this point, you have relied on a conceptual model of the memory system as a linear array with uniform access times.
* Finally, we show you how to improve the performance of application programs by improving their temporal and spatial locality.
* introducing the general concept of exceptional control flow (i.e., changes in control flow that are outside the normal branches and procedure calls).We cover examples of exceptional control flow that exist at all levels of the system, from low-level hardware ex- ceptions and interrupts, to context switches between concurrent processes, to abrupt changes in control flow caused by the receipt of Linux signals, to the nonlocal jumps in C that break the stack discipline.
* Few of our students would have the opportunity to build a computer system. On the other hand, most students, including all computer scientists and computer engineers, would be required to use and program computers on a daily basis
* Topics such as machine language were in; but instead of focusing on how to write assembly language by hand, we would look at how a C compiler translates C con- structs into machine code, including pointers, loops, procedure calls, and switch statements.
