System (Ubuntu) Adminstration and Prblems
==========================================

* Low-disk space, How to resize the ``home`` safely?, how to maintain the ``dot files``?  
* move directories from ``home/user`` another drive: ``pyenv``, ``poetry``, ``homebrew``.. Moving pyenv root <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/issues/226>`_
* Can't run the installed packages direclty from the commad line, but should run it strating from `/home`: I think it's a `bashrc` problem or something
*
